	Novel Objects: Human vs Alien
	Tablet/browser forced choice novel word learning task 
	This particular task is intended to introduce participants to a human character and an alien character. These characters are equally knowledgeable on objects familiar to participants (ie apple, ball, etc.) and as such provide the same label for these objects. The manipulation is that the human and alien provide conflicting labels for novel objects. The goal of this task is to see what label participants believe is correct for each novel object. This will hopefully provide insight into who the participants believe is the more knowledgeable/more trustworthy informant.
